23 June 2015 - Asia Cup!

I've added a small Asia Cup update as a thank you for your patience.
The game was temporarily broken for a day as I upgraded the fielders, but it should work fine now.
Everyone who updates to version 34 should get a one-time 250CR gift!

23 June 2015 - Fielding 2.1 update!

There seems to be a problem where you can't score many singles or doubles
due to the speed of the fielders. I've fixed that in update 34, available now.

22 June 2015 - Fielding 2.0 update

The new update, version 33, should be out at 1200 GMT today.

I've upgraded the fielders so they should chase the ball much better now.
However, all the fielders run towards the ball. A lot of you think that looks silly, so 
I'm changing that.

I'm currently doing my university exams, so there won't be an update for a couple of weeks.
The next update will be ready by The Ashes, adding your favourite 1v1 test series to the game!
