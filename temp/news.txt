20 July 2015 - Injury setback

Sorry guys, I bruised my fingers while playing cricket (oh, the irony!) and will take a bit longer to deliver the next update.

14 July 2015 - Ashes Update update

I'm still working hard on creating a unique Ashes experience. Instead of a long-winded series of Test matches, I've decided to build an ever-increasing list of scenarios that will reflect some of the fantastic events in Ashes history.

The Multiplayer mode is still being worked on, and I will have more news about it in the next few weeks.

1 July 2015 - Exams over!

Thanks for being patient. I haven't had time to answer feedback emails or work on the game in the last week, but development is in full swing now!
I'm currrently working on The Ashes and will also optimise the game to use less CPU and memory, making your devices less hot!

23 June 2015 - Asia Cup!

I've added a small Asia Cup update as a thank you for your patience.
The game was temporarily broken for a day as I upgraded the fielders, but it should work fine now.
Everyone who updates to version 34 should get a one-time 250CR gift!

23 June 2015 - Fielding 2.1 update!

There seems to be a problem where you can't score many singles or doubles
due to the speed of the fielders. I've fixed that in update 34, available now.

---

22 June 2015 - Fielding 2.0 update

The new update, version 33, should be out at 1200 GMT today.

I've upgraded the fielders so they should chase the ball much better now.
However, all the fielders run towards the ball. A lot of you think that looks silly, so 
I'm changing that.

22 June 2015 - Exam time!

I'm currently doing my university exams, so there won't be an update for a couple of weeks.
The next update will be ready by The Ashes, adding your favourite 1v1 test series to the game!

22 June 2015 - Quick-fix update

More news coming soon...
