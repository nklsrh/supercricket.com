14 July 2015 - Ashes Update update

I'm still working hard on creating a unique Ashes experience. Instead of a long-winded series of Test matches, I've decided to build an ever-increasing list of scenarios that will reflect some of the fantastic events in Ashes history.

The Multiplayer mode is still being worked on, and I will have more news about it in the next few weeks.

23 June 2015 - Fielding 2.1 update!

There seems to be a problem where you can't score many singles or doubles

---

22 June 2015 - Fielding 2.0 update

The new update, version 33, should be out at 1200 GMT today.

I've upgraded the fielders so they should chase the ball much better now.
However, all the fielders run towards the ball. A lot of you think that looks silly, so
I'm changing that.
