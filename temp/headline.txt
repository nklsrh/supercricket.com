- Injury setback
Sorry guys, I bruised my fingers while playing cricket (oh, the irony!) and will take a bit longer to deliver the next update.

- Update 34/35 "Asia Cup"
Easier to score 1s and 2s. Adds Asia Cup. Everyone who updates to v34 will get 250CR free!
Asia Cup has a bug when reaching the final. Update 35 fixes the issue.
