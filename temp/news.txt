I'm currently doing my university exams, so there will not be an update for a couple of weeks.
The next update will be ready by The Ashes, adding your favourite 1v1 test series to the game!

22 June 2015 - Quick-fix update

This update fixes issues with Asus and other phones that crash after every match ends.
It also makes fielder movements a little less stupid!
I have begun work on 2 brand-new game modes that everyone should be able to enjoy! More new coming soon...
