22 June 2015 - Fielding 2.0 update

The new update, version 33, should be out at 1200 GMT today.

I've upgraded the fielders so they should chase the ball much better now.
However, all the fielders run towards the ball. A lot of you think that looks silly, so 
I'm changing that.

This update fixes issues with Asus phones and others that crash after every match ends.
